# Step 5 - API Data Integration with components

Now that we have some actual data, we can now display it.

## ðŸ¥‡ Goal

- The goal of this step is to display the list of Pokemon that we retrieved and display them.

## ðŸŽ¬ Concepts

- Reading JSON data
- Displaying JSON to our components
- Integrating logic with components

## ðŸ“š Tasks

Before displaying the array of components, lets go over how
the JSON data looks like.

For example, we can see how each data looks like through:

```javascript
pokemon.map(selectedPokemon => {
  console.log(selectedPokemon);
});
```

We need to convert the array of `pokemon` into an array of components so that we can render the images, name and typing.There are several ways, but the most common approach is to use `Array.prototype.map`:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const [pokemon, setPokemon] = useState([]);
  const name = 'Bryan Wong';

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchPokemon = async () => {
      try {
        const pokemonResults = await loadPokemon();
        setPokemon(pokemonResults.results);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(err);
      }
    };
    fetchPokemon();
  }, []);

  return (
    <StyledContainer className='site-card-wrapper'>
      <Row>
        <PokeCard />
      </Row>
    </StyledContainer>
  );
};
```
